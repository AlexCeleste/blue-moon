 Blue Moon
===========

**About:**

Blue Moon is an implementation of Lua. It is intended to provide superior integration in the long run with the BlitzMax object system, compared to the reference implementation. It uses a hybrid JIT/interpreter for its execution engine in the (vain?) hope of being somewhat faster than a pure interpreter would be.

Blue Moon is a completely original work, containing no code from PUC-Rio's stock Lua (designed against the language manual). [Licence](LICENSE) is MIT/X11, the same as stock Lua.

Blue Moon is a work in progress, and at the moment is **extremely incomplete**. Feel free to look at it, but many (most?) features are not implemented, and those that are present are not guaranteed to work correctly. A partial roadmap can be viewed in the [issues file](issues.txt).

Blue Moon aims to implement Lua 5.3.
